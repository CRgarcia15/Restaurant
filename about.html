        <p>We have recently opened our newest location on 42nd Street New York because of the void of authentic Thai food in New York.
            Since opening our first restaurant in Ralegih North Carolina, the demand of authentic Thai food had gotten too big for just one store. 
            We have seen and heard your demands, and we are excited to let you know that there are more locations in the works that will be coming soon.
            Thank you to all of our partners and comunities that have been with us since the begining.
